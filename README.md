# Next.js Frontend with Hardhat Smart Contract

## Overview

This repository is a Next.js project designed to interact with a Hardhat smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The frontend application provides a user interface for interacting with the smart contract and viewing data from the blockchain.

## Features

- **Frontend Development:** Build dynamic and responsive user interfaces using Next.js.
- **Smart Contract Integration:** Interact with Ethereum smart contracts using ethers.js.
- **Data Display:** Fetch and display blockchain data in the frontend application.

## Smart Contract Repository

The smart contract that this frontend interacts with is available in my repository namely `EtherTransferContract`. You can view and manage the contract's code and deployment from there.

- **Smart Contract Repository:** [EtherTransferContract](https://github.com/JasonTongg/EtherTransferContract)

## Frontend Application

This frontend application is designed to interface with the smart contract to provide a user-friendly experience for interacting with the blockchain. The application fetches data from the smart contract and displays it to the user, allowing for interaction with the deployed contract functions.

### Contract Address

The smart contract is deployed at the following address:

- **Contract Address:** `0x503e714380f1134071C17455E3C7Bd76AA7137Ec`
